## My process
Using a main div container with **id-#main**, it contained the QR code image. Then i created another another div with **id-#text** where i placed the necessary texts as different blick elements.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

i learned a bit more of how to implement media queries.


### Continued development
Continued development in scaling elements both in desktop and mobile. This design is not looking so well on desktop view as i intended.
